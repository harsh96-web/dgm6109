    <!-- HYPOTHESIS -->
    <section class="hypothesis-section">
        <h2>🎯 Research Hypothesis</h2>

        <div class="hypothesis-box">
            <p class="main-hypothesis">
                As protein intake increases, sleep hours also increase.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="hypothesis-explanation">
            For this project, I focused on two main factors: <strong>daily protein intake</strong> and
            <strong>sleep duration</strong>. These two variables form the core of the hypothesis.
            I tracked both consistently over 30 days to see whether higher nutritional intake aligns
            with better overnight recovery, measured through longer sleep.
        </p>

    <!-- ADDITIONAL DIMENSIONS -->
    <section class="dimensions-section">
        <h2>📊 Additional Dimensions Included</h2>

        <p class="intro-text">
            Beyond the two main variables, this visualization also uses two supporting dimensions:
            <strong>workout duration</strong> and <strong>restfulness</strong>. These help explain
            why certain days behave differently, even when protein and sleep levels appear similar.
        </p>

        <!-- WORKOUT -->
        <div class="dimension-card">
            <h3>🔵 Workout Duration (Minutes)</h3>
            <p>
                Each battery displays workout time as a blue label (e.g., <strong>“45 min”</strong>).
                This shows how training intensity interacts with protein and sleep patterns.
            </p>
            <p>
                Often, the days with both high protein and long sleep also include longer workouts,
                suggesting these three behaviors reinforce each other.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- RESTFULNESS -->
        <div class="dimension-card">
            <h3>🌈 Restfulness (1–5 Color Scale)</h3>
            <p>
                Battery fill color represents recovery quality—ranging from tired (red) to excellent (green).
                This adds a meaningful layer of insight by showing not just how long I slept,
                but how restorative that sleep actually felt.
            </p>
            <p>
                Days with green restfulness typically show consistent protein, balanced workouts,
                and enough sleep to support full recovery.
            </p>

    <!-- DATA COLLECTION -->
    <section class="data-section">
        <h2>📈 Data Collection Process</h2>

        <p>
            Data was collected for 30 consecutive days using the same routine each morning.
            All values were self-tracked and kept consistent to ensure accuracy.
        </p>

        <div class="data-grid">
            <div class="data-item">
                <h4>💪 Workout Duration</h4>
                <p><strong>Range:</strong> 0–100 minutes</p>

            <div class="data-item">
                <h4>😴 Sleep Hours</h4>

                <h4>🍗 Protein Intake</h4>

        </div>

        <p class="data-summary">
            The full dataset contains all 30 days without missing values,
            covering heavy training days, moderate days, and full rest days.

    <!-- OBSERVATIONS FOR DRAFT 2 -->
    <section class="conclusion-section">
        <h2>🔍 Observations & Insights (Draft 2)</h2>

        <div class="observation-card highlight">
            <h3>Observation 1 – Higher Protein Often Aligns with Higher Sleep</h3>
            <p>
                Many days with protein intake above 140g show longer sleep durations (7.8h+).
                These often appear in green recovery zones, reinforcing the hypothesis.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="observation-card">
            <h3>Observation 2 – Low Recovery Days Highlight Other Factors</h3>
            <p>
                Red-outlined batteries reveal days with poor restfulness.
                Even when protein was high, these days show that recovery can still be low
                due to long workouts or inconsistent sleep.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="observation-card">
            <h3>Observation 3 – Workout Intensity Influences Sleep</h3>
            <p>
                Some of the strongest relationships appear when protein intake,
                sleep duration, and workout duration all align—suggesting the connection
                is multi-factor rather than strictly two-factor.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="conclusion-box">
            <h3>🎯 Final Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Draft 2 supports the hypothesis but also shows that protein and sleep do
                not work in isolation. Workout intensity and recovery quality significantly
                influence how these two variables interact. Overall, the visualization
                suggests a broader pattern of balanced training, nutrition, and sleep.
