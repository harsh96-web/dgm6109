  <h1>Phase 3b: Term Project Sketches</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Harsh Kumar</p>


  <div class="intro">
    <h2>About My Data</h2>
    <p>
      For this project, I collected personal fitness and wellness data over a 12-day period from September 25 to October 6, 2025. Each day, I tracked four different metrics to explore how they might be related to each other.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>What I tracked every day:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Workout Duration:</strong> How many minutes I spent exercising (range: 50-102 minutes)</li>
      <li><strong>Sleep Hours:</strong> How many hours I slept each night (range: 6.0-8.5 hours)</li>
      <li><strong>Protein Intake:</strong> How many grams of protein I consumed (range: 80-150 grams)</li>
      <li><strong>Restfulness:</strong> How rested I felt, rated on a scale of 1-5 (1 = very tired, 5 = excellent rest)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      I manually recorded these measurements daily and used them to create three different visualizations exploring potential relationships between physical activity, nutrition, sleep quality, and overall wellness.
    </p>
  </div>

  <!-- SKETCH 1 -->
  <div class="sketch-section">
    <h2>Sketch 1: Protein Intake vs Sleep Quality with Workout Duration</h2>
    
  <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
<div class="hypothesis-box">
  <p>
    As <strong>protein intake (grams)</strong> increases, 
    <strong>sleep hours (hours)</strong> also tend to rise, 
    suggesting that higher protein consumption supports better overnight recovery.
  </p>

  <p>
    Additionally, longer <strong>workout duration (minutes)</strong> is linked with 
    <strong>better sleep quality</strong>, represented by 
    <strong>larger bubble sizes</strong> in the scatterplot.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>restfulness level (1–5)</strong> is shown through <strong>color</strong> — 
    ranging from <span style="color:#e74c3c;">red (very tired)</span> to 
    <span style="color:#27ae60;">dark green (excellent rest)</span> — 
    reflecting how recovery improves with both protein intake and workout intensity.
  </p>
</div>

    
    <h3>Which specific data elements are used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>X-axis: Protein Intake</li>
      <li>Y-axis: Sleep Hours</li>
      <li>Bubble Size: Workout Duration</li>
      <li>Bubble Color: Restfulness Level</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Units and approximate range for each piece of data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Protein Intake: measured in grams, estimated range 80-150 grams per day</li>
      <li>Sleep Hours: measured in hours, estimated range 6.0-8.5 hours per night</li>
      <li>Workout Duration: measured in minutes, estimated range 50-102 minutes per session</li>
      <li>Restfulness: measured on 1-5 scale where 1 = very tired and 5 = excellent rest</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How the data will be represented in the visualization</h3>
    <p>
      This is a scatterplot where each bubble represents one day of data. The horizontal position (X-axis) shows how much protein I consumed that day, ranging from 0 to 160 grams. The vertical position (Y-axis) shows how many hours I slept, ranging from 0 to 10 hours. The size of each bubble represents my workout duration - bigger bubbles mean longer workouts. The color of each bubble shows my restfulness level using five colors: red for level 1 (very tired), orange for level 2, yellow for level 3, light green for level 4, and dark green for level 5 (excellent rest). Both axes start at 0 and include clear tick marks and labels. The visualization includes two legends - one showing the five restfulness colors and one showing example bubble sizes for different workout durations.

  <div class="sketch-section">
    <h2>Sketch 2: 12-Day Fitness Progress - Three Key Metrics Over Time</h2>
    
    <h3>Research Question</h3>
    <div class="hypothesis-box">
      How do workout duration, sleep hours, and protein intake change together over the 12-day period? This visualization shows the temporal progression of all three fitness metrics to identify whether they improve in coordination or independently.
    </div>
    
    <h3>Which specific data elements are used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>X-axis: Day Number (1 through 12, representing Sept 25 to Oct 6)</li>
      <li>Y-axis: Normalized Value (0-10 scale)</li>
      <li>Blue Line: Workout Duration (normalized)</li>
      <li>Green Line: Sleep Hours (actual values)</li>
      <li>Red Line: Protein Intake (normalized)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Units and approximate range for each piece of data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Day Number: sequential values 1 to 12, representing the 12 consecutive days from September 25 to October 6, 2025</li>
      <li>Workout Duration: measured in minutes, range 50-102 minutes per session (shown on chart as 4.2 to 8.5 after dividing by 12)</li>
      <li>Sleep Hours: measured in hours, range 6.0-8.5 hours per night (shown as actual values)</li>
      <li>Protein Intake: measured in grams, range 80-150 grams per day (shown on chart as 5.3 to 10.0 after dividing by 15)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How the data will be represented in the visualization</h3>
    <p>
      This is a multi-line chart showing how three different metrics change over time. The X-axis shows the day number from 1 to 12, and the Y-axis shows values on a 0-10 normalized scale. I divided the workout minutes by 12 and protein grams by 15 so that all three metrics would fit on the same 0-10 scale and be easy to compare. The green line shows actual sleep hours without any transformation. Each line has small circular data points marking the value for each day, and the lines connect these points to show the trend. The chart includes vertical grid lines at each day to make it easier to read specific values. A legend at the bottom explains what each colored line represents and shows the actual data ranges before normalization.

  <div class="sketch-section">
    <h2>Sketch 3: 12-Day Fitness Battery - Energy Progress Dashboard</h2>
    
    <h3>Creative Research Question</h3>
    <div class="hypothesis-box">
      How do all four fitness metrics (workout duration, sleep hours, protein intake, and restfulness level) improve over the 12-day period, and what does a balanced, high-performing fitness day look like? This creative visualization uses the battery metaphor to show daily "energy levels" across multiple dimensions.
    </div>
    
    <h3>Which specific data elements are used (all four metrics)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Battery Width: Protein Intake</li>
      <li>Battery Fill Level: Sleep Hours</li>
      <li>Blue Dots Above Battery: Workout Duration</li>
      <li>Battery Fill Color: Restfulness Level</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Units and approximate range for each piece of data</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Protein Intake: measured in grams, range 80-150 grams per day (shown as battery width from 1.0 to 2.1 inches)</li>
      <li>Sleep Hours: measured in hours, range 6.0-8.5 hours per night (shown as fill percentage from 60% to 85%)</li>
      <li>Workout Duration: measured in minutes, range 50-102 minutes per session (shown as 1 to 5 blue dots)</li>
      <li>Restfulness: measured on 1-5 scale from very tired to excellent rest (shown as fill color from red to dark green)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>How the data will be represented in the visualization</h3>
    <p>
      This visualization uses a battery charging metaphor to show fitness improvement. Each of the 12 days is represented by one battery icon. The battery width increases with protein intake - Day 1 (80g) has a narrow 1-inch battery while Day 12 (150g) has a wide 2.1-inch battery. The fill level represents sleep hours as a percentage - Day 1 with 6.0 hours is 60% full while Day 12 with 8.5 hours is 85% full. All batteries are 3 inches tall and fill from the bottom up. Above each battery are blue circular dots representing workout duration - 1 dot for 50-60 minutes, 2 dots for 65-75 minutes, 3 dots for 78-86 minutes, 4 dots for 90-94 minutes, and 5 dots for 98-102 minutes. The color of the filled portion uses the same five-color restfulness scale as Sketch 1 (red = very tired, dark green = excellent). This creates a "charging up" effect where Day 1 shows a narrow, half-full red battery with 1 dot (low energy state) and Day 12 shows a wide, almost-full dark green battery with 5 dots (peak energy state). The batteries are arranged in two rows showing the complete chronological progression, making it easy to see that all four metrics improve together over time.

    <h2>Design Resources and How I Used Them</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Dear Data by Giorgia Lupi and Stefanie Posavec</strong> (http://www.dear-data.com/theproject)</p>
    <p>
      This project helped me think about creative ways to visualize personal data in Sketch 3. Specifically, I was inspired by how they use everyday objects and metaphors to represent data - like using weather symbols for emotions. This gave me the idea to use battery icons as a metaphor for "charging up" my fitness levels over 12 days. Without this resource, I probably would have created a standard chart instead of the creative battery visualization.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Data Visualisation Catalogue</strong> (https://datavizcatalogue.com/index.html)</p>
    <p>
      I used the "Search By Function" page to find visualization types that work for comparing multiple variables over time. This helped me decide on a multi-line chart for Sketch 2 because the catalogue explained that line charts are good for showing trends and patterns when you have multiple data series sharing the same time-based axis. This confirmed that putting all three metrics on one chart would make it easier to see if they move together or separately.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Observable D3 Gallery</strong> (https://observablehq.com/@d3/gallery)</p>
    <p>
      I looked at bubble chart examples to understand how to encode multiple dimensions in a scatterplot for Sketch 1. Specifically, I learned that using different bubble sizes requires careful scaling - the examples showed me that bubble area (not diameter) should be proportional to the data value. I also learned from these examples that using some transparency on bubbles helps when they overlap, which is why I made note of that in my sketch design.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Class lecture on proportional ink and data visualization principles</strong></p>
    <p>
      The lecture's discussion of the "rule of proportional ink" directly influenced how I designed bubble sizes in Sketch 1 and fill percentages in Sketch 3. This rule says that the amount of ink (or color) should be proportional to the data value it represents. For the battery visualization, this meant using fill percentage (like 60% for 6 hours out of 10 possible) rather than arbitrary heights, ensuring an accurate visual representation.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>From Data to Viz</strong> (https://www.data-to-viz.com/)</p>
    <p>
      I used the decision tree tool on this website to verify my visualization type choices. Starting from "two numerical variables" led me to confirm that scatterplots work well for Sketch 1's protein-sleep relationship. For Sketch 2, I followed the path for "one categorical (time) and several numerical variables" which confirmed that multi-line charts are appropriate for showing multiple metrics over the same time period.
