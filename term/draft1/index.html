    <!-- HYPOTHESIS (TWO FACTORS ONLY) -->
    <section class="hypothesis-section">
        <h2>🎯 Research Hypothesis</h2>
        <div class="hypothesis-box">
            <p class="main-hypothesis">As protein intake increases, sleep hours also increase.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="hypothesis-explanation">
            This Draft 1 tests the relationship between <strong>two variables only</strong>: daily protein
            intake (in grams) and nightly sleep duration (in hours). Over a continuous 30-day period,
            I recorded both metrics to evaluate whether higher nutritional intake corresponds with longer
            overnight recovery time. This satisfies the rubric requirement of analyzing exactly two factors.
        </p>

    <!-- ADDITIONAL DIMENSIONS -->
    <section class="dimensions-section">
        <h2>📊 Additional Data Dimensions in the Visualization</h2>

        <p class="intro-text">
            Although the hypothesis compares two variables, the visualization also includes
            <strong>two additional dimensions</strong> to provide meaningful context. These extra
            dimensions are <em>not</em> part of the hypothesis but help explain differences between
            high-performance days and low-performance days.
        </p>

        <!-- WORKOUT DURATION -->
        <div class="dimension-card">
            <h3>🔵 Workout Duration (Blue Text Label)</h3>
            <p>
                Workout duration (0–100 minutes) is encoded as a blue label above each battery, such as
                <strong>"45 min"</strong> or <strong>"0 min"</strong>. This keeps the overall battery design
                clean while still making daily activity levels easy to compare.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Connection to the hypothesis:</strong> Many days showing both high protein intake and
                long sleep hours also include longer workouts. This suggests that exercise intensity may influence
                how strongly the protein–sleep relationship appears on certain days.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- RESTFULNESS COLOR SCALE -->
        <div class="dimension-card">
            <h3>🌈 Restfulness Quality (Color Scale)</h3>
            <p>
                Battery color represents self-rated restfulness on a scale from 3 to 5. Red indicates low
                restfulness, yellow indicates moderate recovery, and green indicates excellent recovery.
                This adds a qualitative measure of sleep quality on top of sleep duration.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Connection to the hypothesis:</strong> Restfulness explains situations where sleep
                hours are high but recovery is low, or where both sleep and restfulness improve on days with
                higher nutritional intake and more intense physical training.

    <!-- DATA COLLECTION -->
    <section class="data-section">
        <h2>📈 Data Collection Process</h2>
        <p>
            I collected data every morning for 30 consecutive days. Each entry includes workout duration,
            sleep hours, protein intake, and restfulness rating. All recordings were made using consistent
            methods to ensure reliability.
        </p>

        <div class="data-grid">
            <div class="data-item">

    <!-- OBSERVATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS -->
    <section class="conclusion-section">
        <h2>🔍 Observations and Conclusions</h2>

        <div class="observation-card highlight">
            <h3>Observation 1 – High Protein Aligns with High Sleep</h3>
            <p>
                Days with protein intake above 140g consistently show sleep hours above 8.0 hours.
                These days also tend to include longer workouts and greener restfulness scores,
                suggesting a positive relationship between exercise, nutrition, and sleep.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="observation-card">
            <h3>Observation 2 – Low Workout Days Show Lower Recovery</h3>
            <p>
                Rest days (<strong>0 min workouts</strong>) generally show narrower batteries, lower
                sleep duration, and more yellowish restfulness colors. Even when sleep hours remain
                reasonable, subjective recovery tends to be lower.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="observation-card">
            <h3>Observation 3 – Middle-Week Low-Recovery Cluster</h3>
            <p>
                Several days (e.g., Days 4, 9, 13, 19) show lower fill level, moderate restfulness,
                and shorter workouts. These represent the lowest recovery states in the dataset.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="conclusion-box">
            <h3>🎯 Final Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Draft 1 supports the hypothesis: higher protein intake generally aligns with longer sleep
                hours. However, the additional variables reveal that this relationship is influenced by
                workout intensity and subjective restfulness. Instead of a simple two-factor connection,
                the visualization points to a multi-factor wellbeing pattern involving training, nutrition,
                sleep duration, and recovery quality.
