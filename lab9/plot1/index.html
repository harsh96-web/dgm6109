    <h1>Workout Duration vs Sleep Hours: A 12-Day Training Analysis</h1>
    <h3>Harsh Kumar — Lab #9, Plot 1</h3>

    <p class="hypothesis">
      <strong>Hypothesis:</strong>
      As workout duration increases over time, sleep requirements also increase to support recovery. 
      I expect that heavier training sessions (especially compound lifts like squats and deadlifts) 
      demand longer sleep compared to lighter workouts. Protein intake should amplify this relationship, 
      with higher protein supporting better restfulness at any sleep duration. This visualization uses 
      <strong>Array.sort()</strong> to arrange data chronologically, revealing how my training intensity 
      and recovery patterns evolved from September 25 through October 6.
    </p>

      <h3>Why This Visualization Works</h3>
      <p>
        This scatterplot effectively captures my 12-day fitness journey by showing four interconnected 
        variables: workout duration (X-axis), sleep hours (Y-axis), protein intake (bubble size), and 
        restfulness (bubble color). The chronological sorting reveals a clear upward trend — as I 
        progressed from 50-minute moderate workouts to 102-minute heavy lifting sessions, my sleep needs 
        increased from 6 hours to 8.5 hours. The color gradient (red to green) shows that restfulness 
        improved alongside this progression, suggesting my body adapted positively to increased training loads.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes this particularly insightful is the protein dimension. Larger bubbles (higher protein 
        intake) consistently appear at higher restfulness levels, validating my hypothesis that adequate 
        protein supports better recovery. By hovering over any point, you can see the specific exercises 
        performed (bench press weights, squat loads, etc.), directly addressing my professor's feedback 
        about workout specificity. Without the chronological sorting via Array.sort(), this progression 
        story would be invisible — just scattered data points rather than a clear fitness trajectory.
