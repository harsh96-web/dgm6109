    <h1>Does More Protein Improve Recovery on Heavy Workout Days?</h1>

    <p class="hypo">
      <strong>Question:</strong>
      On <em>heavy workout days</em> involving strength-based exercises such as squats or bench press,
      does higher <em>protein intake (grams)</em> relate to better <em>sleep duration (hours)</em> and improved <em>restfulness</em>?  
      Bubble size represents <em>workout duration (minutes)</em>, used as an approximate indicator of intensity.

      <em>AI Insight:</em> Filtering to heavy workout sessions reveals how consistent protein intake and sufficient sleep
      contribute to faster recovery. An AI model could later highlight “under-recovery” days based on these patterns.
